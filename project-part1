Introduction

Paolo wants to open his pizzeria in some neighborhood of Zürich Switzerland. But he wants to ensure that his restaurant will be 
near some offices or schools in order to ensure he will have enough customers. Having some shops or places for night activities would
also be great. 
He also wish that they won't be too many other pizzerias near to his one.


Business Problem 

To help Paolo in his search we will need to:
- get the neighborhoods of Zürich, Switzerland

- get the restaurant venues of the neighborhoods (and specifically the pizzerias)

- get the offices venues of the neighborhoods
- get the shops venues of the neighborhoods
- get the schools venues of the neighborhoods
- get the night activities venues of the neighborhoods

We will then leverage the data in order to determine which neighborhood has the most officies, shops, schools and night activities
with the less pizzerias. This would be a good neighborhood for Paolo in order to open his restaurant.
