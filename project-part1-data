Data

To help Paolo in his search we will need to use following data:

- The neighborhoods of Zürich, Switzerland from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivisions_of_Z%C3%BCrich

- The coordinates (latitude, longitude) ot these neighborhoods and of Zürich from GoogleAPIs

- From Foursquare we will need following venues data:
  - the restaurant venues of the neighborhoods (and specifically the pizzerias)
  - the offices venues of the neighborhoods
  - the shops venues of the neighborhoods
  - the schools venues of the neighborhoods
  - the night activities venues of the neighborhoods

We will then leverage the data in order to determine which neighborhood has the most officies, shops, schools and night activities
with the less pizzerias. This would be a good neighborhood for Paolo in order to open his restaurant.
